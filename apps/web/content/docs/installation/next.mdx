<Steps>

### Create project

Run the `init` command to create a new Next.js project or to setup an existing one:

```bash
npx nyxb@latest init
```

<Callout className="mt-4">

You can use the `-d` flag for defaults i.e `miami`, `zinc` and `yes` for the css variables.

```bash
npx nyxb@latest init -d
```

</Callout>

### Configure components.json

You will be asked a few questions to configure `components.json`:

```txt showLineNumbers
Which style would you like to use? › Miami
Which color would you like to use as base color? › Zinc
Do you want to use CSS variables for colors? › no / yes
```

### That's it

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx nyxb@latest add button
```

The command above will add the `Button` component to your project. You can then import it like this:

```tsx {1,6} showLineNumbers
import { Button } from "~/components/ui/button"

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

</Steps>
