I love [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn/ui), it's amazing. However, sometimes I feel like something is missing. For example, there are a lot of PRs, but it seems like many of the ones I find really great don't get merged. While I can implement these changes myself, I would prefer to have them all compactly in one configuration. Additionally, I like to have control over everything I use.

So, I came up with the idea to customize it for myself since shadcn/ui states that everything is completely free to use. Then, I discovered [MagicUI](https://github.com/magicuidesign/magicui), as I do a lot with Framer Motion, and it had some fantastic components. However, it didn't have a CLI to automatically install the components. This led me to the idea of **fusing both together**. With both combined and the ones I created myself, this library now has over **150+ components** and is constantly growing.

If I find other component libraries that serve the same purpose, I will integrate them as well. I hope that others who like this idea will also contribute productively to the fusion library.

**Key Points:**
- **shadcn/ui**: Great but missing some features.
- **MagicUI**: Fantastic components but lacks a CLI.
- **Fusion Library**: Over 150 components and growing.
- **Open for Contributions**: Looking for others to help improve the library.
